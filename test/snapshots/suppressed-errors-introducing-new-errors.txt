Errors marked with (unsuppressed) were previously suppressed, but you introduced
another error for the same rule in a file where those errors were already being
suppressed. Please fix them until you have at most as many as errors are before.

Errors marked with (fix) can be fixed automatically using `elm-review --fix`.

I found 2 errors in 1 file.
