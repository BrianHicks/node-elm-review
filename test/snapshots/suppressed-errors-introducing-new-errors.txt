Errors marked with (unsuppressed) were previously suppressed, but you introduced
new errors for the same rule and file. There are now more of those than what I
previously allowed. Please fix them until you have at most as many errors as
before. Maybe fix a few more while you're there?

Errors marked with (fix) can be fixed automatically using `elm-review --fix`.

I found 2 errors in 1 file.
