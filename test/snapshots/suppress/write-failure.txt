-- FAILED TO UPDATE SUPPRESSION FILE -------------------------------------------

I tried updating the suppression file in the review/suppressed/ folder, but failed to write to review/suppressed/NoUnused.Variables.json.

Please check that elm-review has write permissions to that file and folder. In case it helps, here's the error I encountered:

  Error: EACCES: permission denied, open '<local-path>/test/project-with-suppressed-errors-no-write/review/suppressed/NoUnused.Variables.json'
