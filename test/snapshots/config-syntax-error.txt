-- CONFIGURATION COMPILATION ERROR ---------------------------------------------

Errors occurred while compiling your configuration for elm-review. I need your
configuration to compile in order to know how to analyze your files. Hopefully
the compiler error below will help you figure out how to fix it.

-- UNEXPECTED SQUARE BRACKET - <local-path>/config-syntax-error/src/ReviewConfig.elm

I ran into an unexpected square bracket:

21|     ]
        ^
This ] does not match up with an earlier open square bracket. Try deleting it?
