All done! I have created a review project at review/ for you.

You chose to use someone's review configuration which can be great to get started
but don't forget to review the configuration to make sure it fits your needs,
both by removing rules you disagree with and by finding new rules to aid you.
You can do so by editing review/src/ReviewConfig.elm.

I recommend you take a look at the following documents:
  - How to configure elm-review: https://github.com/jfmengels/elm-review/#Configuration
  - When to write or enable a rule: https://github.com/jfmengels/elm-review/#when-to-write-or-enable-a-rule

By starting out with this configuration, you may end up with too many errors to handle at once.
I recommend you use a mix of the following approaches:
  - Enable rules one by one by commenting them out at first
  - Use elm-review suppress to suppress existing errors but prevent future ones (see elm-review suppress --help).
