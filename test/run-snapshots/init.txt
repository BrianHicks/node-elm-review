[?25hAll done! I have created a review project at review/ for you.

You can now define your review configuration by editing review/src/ReviewConfig.elm.

I recommend you take a look at the following documents:
  - How to configure elm-review: https://github.com/jfmengels/elm-review/#Configuration
  - When to write or enable a rule: https://github.com/jfmengels/elm-review/#when-to-write-or-enable-a-rule
